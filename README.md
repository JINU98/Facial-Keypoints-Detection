# Facial Key Points Detection 
Facial key point detection is crucial for emotional AI based applications like customer response, driver drowsiness detection, sentiment analysis, image filtering etc., while these tasks requires separate discussion, one thing that we find common in all of them that they may use facial key points. To do so in these project we will deal with a CNN architecture to detect facial key points from images. I have also written a blog showing step by step procedure with explanations on how to build this project you can find it here https://facekey.herokuapp.com/

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites
Make sure that you have python pre-installed on your PC.
Things you need to install the software and how to install them:
<br />
tensorflow <br />
matplotlib <br />
keras <br />
```
